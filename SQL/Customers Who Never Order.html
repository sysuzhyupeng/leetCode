			Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

			Table: Customers.

			| 1  | Joe   |
			| 2  | Henry |
			| 3  | Sam   |

			Table: Orders.

			| Id | CustomerId |
			+----+------------+
			| 1  | 3          |
			| 2  | 1          |
			+----+------------+
			Using the above tables as example, return the following:

			+-----------+
			| Customers |
			+-----------+
			| Henry     |
			| Max       |
